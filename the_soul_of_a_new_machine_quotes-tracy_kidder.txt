Engineers want to produce something. "I didn’t go to school for six years just 
to get a paycheck". "If this is what engineering's all about, the hell with it. 
If I was always looking for the buck. I’d get an M.B.A., go back to New York, 
and make some money". But I didn’t really want to do that. I wanted to build 
computers.

Often, it is the most talented engineers who have the hardest time learning 
when to stop striving for perfection.

When you burn out, you lose enthusiasm. I have always loved computers but all 
of a sudden I just didn’t care. It was, all of a sudden, a job.

Look, I don’t have to get official recognition for anything I do. Ninety-eight 
percent of the thrill comes from knowing that the thing you designed works, 
and works almost the way you expected it would. If that happens, part of you is 
in that machine.

Several studies suggest that a fairly large percentage of engineers in America 
are not content with their jobs. Among the reasons cited are the nature of the 
jobs themselves and the restrictive ways in which they are managed. Among the 
terms used to describe their malaise are declining technical challenge; 
misutilization; limited freedom of action; tight control of working patterns.
