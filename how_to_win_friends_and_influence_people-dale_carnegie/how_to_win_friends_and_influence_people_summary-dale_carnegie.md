Actions speak louder than words and a smile says - I like you, you make me
happy. I am glad to see you.

The expression one wears on one's face is far more important than the clothes
one wears on one's back.

The effect of a smile is powerful, even when it is unseen. Your "smile"
comes through in your voice.

and we resent it. Give a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile coming

together and by regulating action, which is under direct control of the
will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.

find it. By controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn't depend on outward

happy. It is what you think that does!

is hourly transforming you into that particular individual. "Thought is Supreme"

The Value of a Smile at Christmas
It costs nothing, but creates much. It enriches those who receive without
impoverishing those who give. It happens in a flash and the memory of it
sometimes lasts forever, none are so rich they can get along without it,
and none so poor but are riches for its benefits. It creates happiness in
the home, fosters good will in a business, and is the countersign of friends.
It is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad,
and Nature's best antidote for trouble. Yet it cannot be bought, begged,
borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is no earthly good to anybody
till it is given away.

We become like that on which our hearts are fixed.

Your smile is a messenger of your good will.

Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it.

in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your
problems.

she treasures most.

he/she enjoys talking about.

Before meeting with anyone, put research forth to figure out what are the
interests of the person you are meeting with.

avoid it.

convinced that he is absolutely right.

Do not resist, defend or debate. Try to build bridges of understanding.

To face an argument:
Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out: 
1. Start first with the points on which you both agree.
2. Be honest and admit any errors, apologize for your mistakes.
3. Seriously consider the argument of your opponent, they might
be right.
4. Always thank your opponents for thinking hard about the problem.
5. If no agreement is attained, postpone any action until both parties
can think over what it was proposed.

The Only Way to Get The Best Of an Argument is to Avoid it.

If you are going to prove anything don't let anybody know it, do it so
subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it.

himself.

people's minds, so why make it harder? Why handicap yourself?

Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.

Quit telling people they are wrong; It only creates resentment and disagreement

There's magic, in phrases such as:
"I might be wrong, let's examine the facts"

By admitting that you may be wrong, you will stop all argument and inspire
your opponents to be just as fair and open as you are, it will make them
want to admit that they to may be wrong.

When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves and if we are handled gently
and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness
and broad mindedness.

a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping
that person of self dignity and making yourself unwelcome.

Find points of agreement with your adversary quickly.

Be diplomatic, it will help you gain your point.

Show respect for the other person's opinion, never say you are wrong.

Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is
thinking or wants to say or intends to say and say them before that person
has a chance to say them, all is left to say then are only good things.

There is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit
one's errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness but it
often helps to solve the problem created by the error.

Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes and most fools do, but it
raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and
exultation to admit one's mistakes.

By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you
expected.

When we are right, let's try to win people gently and tactfully to our way
of thinking and when we are wrong let's admit our mistakes quickly and
with enthusiasm.

Men cannot be forced to change their mind only they can freely make the
choice.

you differ. Begin by emphasizing and keep on emphasizing the things
on which you agree.

In dealing with an argument remember: you are both striving for the same
end and your only difference is of method and not of purpose.

Get the other person saying "yes-yes" at the outset. Keep your opponent if
possible from saying "No". A "No" response is a most difficult handicap
to overcome, because it involves a person's pride.

When a person says "No" and means it, the entire system gathers itself into
a condition of rejection, often one can see the other person in guard
against any acceptance.

When a person says "yes" the person is in a forward-moving, accepting,
open attitude. The more "yes-yes" we can get the more likely we are to
succeed in capturing the attention of our contrary.

Socratic Method for dealing with people:
Try to ask questions for which your opponents would have to agree, through
these you can lead your opponent through a greater understanding of your
position and hopefully to an end to the argument.

He who threads softly goes far!

Get the other person saying "yes-yes" immediately.

Take the trouble to find out about others, show interest in others and let
them do the talking.

Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.

Much like you and me, people like to figure things out for themselves, to
feel like they are the sole owner of their ideas. Therefore, isn't it wiser
to make suggestions and let the other person think out the conclusions.

No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold anything, or ordered to
do something. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or
acting on our own ideas.

Give people credit for their ideas, It's the best way to keep people motivated.

The sage is tolerant and understanding.

Let the other person feel that the ideas is his or hers.

Remember:
Other people may be totally wrong. But they don't think so. Don't condemn
them. Any fool can do that, try to understand them; only wise, tolerant,
exceptional people can do that.

There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Figure out
that reason and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality.
Try honestly to put yourself in his place.

If you can say to yourself, "how would I feel, how would I react if I were
in his shoes" You will save yourself time and irritation, for by becoming
interested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the effect.

Success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other
person's viewpoint.

Cooperativeness in a conversation is achieved when you show that you consider
the other person's ideas and feeling as important as your own.

Start your conversation by giving the other person the purpose or direction
of the conversation. Governing what you say by what you want to hear if
you were the listener and accepting his/her viewpoint will encourage the
listener to have an open mind to your ideas.

for sympathy, give it to them and they will love you for it.

Sympathy for the other's cause, the human species craves.

Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.

A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good
and a real one, in order to change people appeal to the nobler motives.

The fact is that all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and
like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.

Appeal to the nobler motives.

Dramatize your ideas, sometimes it helps to convey your point.

All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes
to death, but always to victory.

The way to get things done is to stimulate competition, not in a sordid money
driven way, but in the desire to excel.

The desire to excel, the challenge, is an infallible way of appealing to
people of spirit.

Give people a challenge to beat.

I have never found that pay and pay alone would either bring together or
hold good people. I think it was the game itself.

The major factor that motivates people is the work itself. If the work is
exciting and interesting, people look forward to doing it every day.

We all love the game; the chance to prove our worth, the desire to excel,
to win, to feel successful and important.

It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard
some praise of our good points.

Always begin with praise and honest appreciation.

convince somebody to changes his/her behavior.

1. Make suggestions.
2. Make curious questions.
3. Give people the opportunity to figure out things themselves, let them
learn from their mistakes.

Always save a person's pride, give him or her a feeling of importance.

Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable, it often stimulates
the creativity of the persons whom you ask.

People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the
decision that caused the order to be issued.

Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.

Let the other person save face.

Before criticizing someone in public, consider the emotional hurt to that
person's pride. Be thoughtful and considerate, treat the other person in
private and let them save face.

I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own
eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of
himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime!

Honest praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit, we cannot flower
and grow without it.

Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only
destroy ego by causing someone else to lose face.

Let the other person save face.

To inspire someone to change their ways, use honest praise instead of
condemnation. Praise even the slightest improvements, let others know you
appreciate their effort.

When criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people
do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.

Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes
across as sincere not something the other person may be saying just to
make one feel good.

Remember: We all crave appreciation and recognition and will do almost
anything to get it but nobody wants insincerity, nobody wants flattery.

Abilities wither under criticism. They blossom under encouragement.

Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.

If you want to improve a person in a certain area act as if you know that
that person already possesses the skills to improve him/herself. Assume
their virtue, if they have it not.

Give others a fine reputation to live up to and they will make prodigious
efforts to exceed expectations.

Make the fault seem easy to correct.

attitude and behavior of others give the other person a fine reputation
to live up to.

the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it.
You will see: He or she will practice until they excel.

If you want to help others to improve, remember:
Use encouragement, make the fault seem easy to correct.

Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

Spend time thinking how to make the other person happy about doing the
thing you suggest.

I shall pass this way but once. Any good, therefore that I can do or any
kindness that I can show to any home being, let me do it now. Let me not
defer not neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.

Rudeness is the cancer that devours love; yet we are more polite to strangers
than to our own relatives.
