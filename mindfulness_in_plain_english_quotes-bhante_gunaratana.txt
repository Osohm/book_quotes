Meditation: The practice of mindfulness.

Meditation is not easy. It takes time and it takes energy. It also 
takes grit, determination and discipline. 

Mediation takes gumption. It requires a host of personal qualities 
that we normally regard as unpleasant and like to avoid whenever 
possible. We can sum up all of these qualities in the American word 
gumption.

We categorize experiences. We try to stick each perception, every 
mental state into one of three holes: It is good, bad, or neutral. 
Then, according to which box we stick it in, we perceive with a set of 
fixed habitual mental responses. 

If a particular perception has been labeled "good" we try to freeze 
time right there. We grab onto that particular thought, fondle it, 
hold it, and we try to keep it from scaping. When that does not work, 
we go all-out in an effort to repeat the experience that caused the 
thought. We can call this mental habit "Grasping."

When we perceive something "bad," we try to push it away. We try to 
deny it, reject it, and get rid of it any way we can. We fight against 
our own experience. We can call this mental habit "rejecting."

Between the "grasping" and "rejecting" mental habits lies the 
"neutral" box. Here we place the experiences that are neither good nor 
bad. They are tepid, neutral, uninteresting. We pack experience away 
in the neutral box so that we can ignore it and thus return our 
attention to where the action is, namely, our endless round of desire 
and aversion. So this "neutral" category gets robbed of its fair share 
of our attention. We can call this mental habit "ignoring."

The direct result of our unhealthy mental habits (i.e.grasping, 
rejecting and ignoring) is a perpetual treadmill race to nowhere, 
endlessly pounding after pleasure, endlessly fleeing from pain, and 
endlessly ignoring 90 percent of our experience. Then we wonder why 
life tastes so flat. In the final analysis this system does not work.

Happiness and peace are really the prime issues in human existence 
(i.e. after our normal survival needs). That is what all of us are 
seeking. 

"Feel good": Nnow there is the real item. What we really seek is not 
the surface goals; those are just means to an end. What we are really 
after is the feeling of relief that comes when the drive is satisfied. 
Relief, relaxation, and an end to the tension. Peace, hapiness - no 
more yearning.

You can not ever get everything you want. It is impossible. Luckily, 
there is another option. You can learn to control your mind, to step 
outside of the endless cycle of desire and aversion. You can learn not 
to want what you want, to recognize desires but not to be controlled 
by them. 

Mindfulness does not mean that you lie down on the road and invite 
everybody to walk all over you. It means that you continue to live a 
very normal-looking life, but live from a whole new viewpoint. You do 
the things a person must do, but you are free from that obsesive, 
compulsive drivenness of your own desires. i.e. You want something, but 
you don't need to chase after it. You fear something, but you don't 
need to stand there quaking in your boots. This sort of mental 
cultivation is very difficult. It takes years.

We are just beginning to realize that we have overdeveloped the 
material aspects of existence at the expense of the deeper emotional 
and spiritual aspects, and we are paying a price for that error.

You can't make radical changes in the pattern of your life until you 
begin to see yourself exactly as you are now. As soon as you do that, 
changes will flow naturally. You don't have to force anything, 
struggle, or obey rules dictated to you by some authority. It is 
automatic; you just change.

You have to see who you are and how you are without illusion, 
judgement, or resistance of any kind. You have to see your place in 
society and your function as a social being. You have to see your 
duties and obligations to your fellow human beings, and above all, 
your responsibility to yourself as an individual living with other 
individuals. Mental cultivation is a great way to help you achieve 
this sort of understanding along with serene hapiness.

A well-disciplined mind brings hapiness.

Meditation is intended to purify the mind. It cleanses the thought 
process of what can be called psychic irritants, things like greed, 
hatred and jealousy, which keep you snarled up in emotional bondage. 
Mediatation brings the mind to a state of tranquility and awareness, a 
state of concentration and insight.

It is one thing to obey the law because you know the penalties and 
fear the consequences; it is something else entirely to obey the law 
because you understand the reasons and have cleansed yourself from the 
hatred that would make you kill.

Civilization changes a person on the outside. Meditation softens a 
person from within, through and through.

Meditation is called the Great Teacher. It is the cleansing element 
that works slowly but surely, through understanding. The greater 
your understanding, the more flexible and tolerant, the more 
compassionate you can be.

When you understand others, you are ready to forgive and forget.

You understand others because you deeply understand yourself. When you 
have learned compassion for yourself, compassion for others is 
automatic.

An accomplished meditator has achieved a profound understanding of 
life, and he or she inevitably relates to the world with a deep and 
uncritical love.

Meditation is a lot like cultivating a new land. To make a field out 
of a forest, first you have to clear the tress and pull out the 
stumps. Then you fill the soil and fertilize it, sow your seed, and 
harvest your crops. To cultivate your mind, first you have to clear 
out the various irritants that are in the way - pull them right out by 
the root so that they won't grow back. Then you fertilize: you pump 
energy and discipline into the mental soil. Then you sow the seed, and 
harvest your crops of faith, morality, mindfulness, and wisdom.

Faith and morality have a special meaning in this context. Budhism 
does not advocate faith in the sense of believing something because it 
is written in a book, attributed to a prophet, or taught to you by 
some authority figure. 

The meaning of faith in budhism is closer to confidence. It is knowing 
that something is true because you have seen it work, because you have 
observed within yourself.

Morality in budhism is not ritualistic obedience to a code of behavior 
imposed by an external authority. It is rather a healthy habit pattern 
that you have consciously and voluntarily chosen to impose upon 
yourself because you recognize it is superior than your present 
behavior.

The purpose of meditation is personal transformation.

Meditation changes your character by a process of sensitization, by 
making you deeply aware of your own thoughts, words, and deeds. 

Through meditation your mind becomes still and calm. And your life 
smoothes out. 

Meditation, properly performed, prepares you to meet the ups and downs 
of existence. It reduces your tension, fear and worry.

Mediation sharpens your concentration and your thinking power. Then, 
piece by piece, your own subconscious motives and mechanics become 
clear to you. Your intuition sharpens. The precision of your thought 
increases and gradually you come to a direct knowledge of things as 
they really are, without prejudice and without illusion.

The idea of mindfulness is to watch the functioning of your mind in a 
calm and detached manner so you can gain insight into your own 
behavior. 

The goal of meditation is awareness, an awareness so intense, so 
concentrated, and finely tuned that you will be able to pierce the 
inner workings of the reality you perceive.

Vipassana, by definition, is the cultivation of mindfulness or 
awareness.

The purpose of meditation is to develop awareness.

There are three integral factors in Buddhist meditation - morality, 
concentration, and wisdom. These three factors grow together as your 
practice deepens. Each one influences the other, so you cultivate the 
three of them at once, not separately.

There are three levels of morality: The lowest level is "adherence", 
the second level is "understanding" and the third level is "ethics". 
The difference is not the fact that you follow the rules but the 
reasons why you do it.

The first level of morality is "adherence". You blindly obey rules 
laid down by somebody else for fear of the consequences 
(physical punishment, penalties, tickets ...etc).

The second level of morality is "understanding". You obey rules because 
you have understood their purpose and internalized the rules.

The third level of morality is "ethics". At the level of ethics, a 
person does not follow hard and fast rules dictated by authority. A 
person chooses to follow a path dictated by mindfulness, wisdom, and 
compassion. This level requires real intelligence, and an ability to 
juggle all the factors in every situation to arrive at a unique, 
creative, and appropriate response each time.

Meditation is running straight into reality. It does not insulate you 
from the pain of life but rather allows you to delve so deeply into 
life and all its aspects that you pierce the pain barrier and go 
beyond suffering. 

Vipassaa is a practice done with the specific intention of facing reality, 
to fully experience life just as it is and to cope with exactly what you 
find. It allow you to blow aside the illusions and free yourself from 
all the polite little lies you tell yourself all the time. What is 
there is there. You are who you are, and lying to yourself about your 
own weaknesses and motivations only binds you tighter to them.

Vipassana is seeing your life unfold from moment to moment without 
biases. What comes up, comes up. It is very simple.

Patience is the key. Patience. If you learn nothing else from 
meditation, you will learn patience. Patience is essential for any 
profound change.

Vipassana is the oldest buddhist meditation practices. The method 
comes directly from the Satipatthana Sutta, a discouse attributed to 
buddha itself. Vipassana is a direct and gradual cultivation of 
mindfulness or awareness. One's attention is carefully diorected to an 
intense examination of certain asepcts of one's own existence.

Vipassana is a form of mental training that will teach you to 
experience the world in an entirely new way. You will learn for the 
first time what is truly happening to you, around you, and within you. 
It is a process of self-discovery, a participatory investigation in 
which you observe your own experiences while participating in them. 

The whole meaning of the word vipassana is looking into something with 
clarity and precision, seeing each component as distinct, and piercing 
all the way through to perceive the most fundamental reality of that 
thing.

vipassana bhavana means the cultivation of the mind towards the aim of 
seeing in the special way that leads to insight and full understanding.

The irony of it is that real peace comes only when you stop chasing it.

When you relax your driving desire for comfort, real fulfillment 
arises. When you drop your hectic pursuit of gratification, the real 
beauty of life comes out. When you seek to know reality without 
illusion, complete with all its pain and danger, real freedom and 
security will be yours. This is not a doctrine we are trying to drill 
into you; it is an observable reality, something you can and should 
see for yourself.

From the buddhist point of view, we human beings live in a very peculiar 
fashion. We view impermanent things as permanent, though everything is 
changing all around us. We must instead observe life as it is and be 
mindful of every detail in our constantly changing world. 

The process of change is constant and eternal. Even as you read these 
words, your body is aging. But you pay no attention to that. The book 
in your hand is decaying . The print is fading, and the pages are 
becoming brittle. Everything is changing but you pay no attention. 
Then one day you look around you. You skin is wrinkled and your joints 
ache. So you pine for lost youth and cry when your possessions are gone. 
Where does this pain come from? It comes from your own inattention. 
You failed to look closely at life, you failed to observe the constantly 
changing word as it passed by. You set up a collection of mental 
constructions and you assumed these were solid, real entities that 
would endure forever. But they never do. 

As soon as a phenomenon pops into the mind, we try mentally to grab onto 
it or push it away. That sets the worry response in motion. Through 
meditation and mindfulness you can short-circuit the whole mechanism.

Vipassana meditation is inherently experiential, not theoretical. In 
the practice of meditation you become sensitive to the actual 
experience of living, to how things actually feel. You do not sit 
around developing sublime thoughts about living. You live. Vipassana 
meditation, more than anything else, is learning to live.

Don't expect anything. Just sit back and see what happens. Treat the 
whole thing  as  an  experiment.  Take  an  active  interest  in  the  
test  itself.  But  don't  get distracted by your expectations about 
results. For that matter, don't be anxious for any result whatsoever. 
Let the meditation move along at its own speed and in its own direction. 

Meditative awareness seeks to see reality exactly as it is. Whether that 
corresponds to our expectations or not, it requires a temporary 
suspension of all our preconceptions and  ideas.  We must  store  away 
our images,  opinions  and  interpretations someplace out of the way 
for the duration. Otherwise we will stumble over them.  

Don't strain. Don't force anything or make grand, exaggerate 
efforts. Meditation is not aggresive. There is no place or need for 
violent striving. Just let your effort be relaxed and steady.

Don't rush. There is no hurry, so take your time. Settle yoursef a 
cushion and sit as though you have the whole day. Anything really 
valuable takes time to develop. Patience, patience, patience, patience.

Don't cling to anything, and don't reject anything. Let come what 
comes, and accomodate yourself to that, whatever it is. if good mental 
images arise, that is fine. If bad mental images arise, that is fine, 
too. Look on all of it as equal, and make yourself comfortable with 
whatever happens. Don't fight with what you experience, just observe 
it all mindfully.

Let go. Learn to flow with all the changes that come up. Loosen up 
and relax.

Accept everything that arises. Accept your feelings, even the ones 
you wish you did not have. Accept your experiences, even the ones you 
hate. Don't condemn yourself for having human flaws and feelings. 
Learn to see all the phenomena in the mind as being perfectly natural 
and understandable.

Be gentle with yourself. Be kind to yourself. You may not be 
perfect, but you are all you've got to work with. The process of 
becoming who you will be begins first with the total acceptance of who 
you are.

Investigate yourself. Question everything. Take nothing for 
granted. Don't believe anything because it sounds wise and pious and 
some holy man said it. See for yourself. That does not mean that you 
should be cynical, impudent, or irreverent. It means you should be 
empirical.

Insight meditation evolves out of an inner longing to wake up to what 
is real. Insight meditation evolves out of an inner longing to wake up 
to what is real.

View all problems as challenges. Look upon negativities that arise 
as opportunities to learn and to grow. Don't run from them, condemn 
yourself, or bury your burden in saintly silence. You have a problem? 
Great. More grist for the mill. Rejoice, dive in, and investigate.

Discursive thinking won't free you from the trap. In meditation
the mind is purified naturally by mindfulness, by wordless bare 
attention. 

Don't compare, don't dwell upon contrasts. Differences do exist between 
people but dwelling upon them is a dangerous process. Unless carefully 
handled, this leads directly to egotism. 

Comparing yourself with others is a mental habit, and it leads directly 
to ill feeling of one sort or another: greed, envy, pride, jealousy, 
or hatred. It is an unskillfull mental state, but we do it all the time. 
We compare ourselves with others and all this leads to the same state 
- estrangement, barriers between people, and ill feeling.

Rather than noticing the differences between oneself and others, 
the meditator trains him or herself to notice the similarities. He/She 
centers her attention on those factors that are universal to all life, 
things that move one closer to others. Then comparisons, if any, lead 
to feelings of kinship rather than of estrangement.

We may feel, greed, lust, or jealousy. We may feel fear, worry, 
restlessness, or boredom. These reactions are also universal. We 
should realize that these reactions are normal human responses, and 
can arise in anybody.


Although there are many subjects of meditation, we strongly recommend 
that you start with focusing your undivided attention on your breathing 
to to gain some degree of basic concentration.

We should find a way to apply our mindfulness to our daily life in 
order for us to be able to handle daily unforeseeable eventualities.

What we face every day is unpredictable. Things happen due to multiple 
causes and conditions, since we live in a conditionap and impemanent 
world. Mindfulness is our emergency kit, readily available at any time.

Mindfulness practice is the practice of being 100 percent honest with 
ourselves.

When greed, hatred, and ignorance reveal themselves in our daily 
lives, we use our mindfulness to track them down and comprehend their 
roots.

We should consider the person who shows our shortcomings as one who 
excavates a hidden treasure of which we were unaware, since it is by 
knowing the existence of our deficiencies that we can improve 
ourselves.

If we are sick, we must find out the cause of our sickness. Only then 
can we get treatment. If we pretend that we are not sick, even though 
we are suffering, we will never get treatment.

If someone becomes unmindfull in indicating faults and uses unkind and 
harsh language, he might do more harm than good to himself as well as 
to the person whose shortcomings he points out. 

The one who speaks with resentment cannot be mindfull and is unable to 
express himself clearly.

We should speak mindfully and listen mindfully to be benefited by 
talking and listening. When we listen and talk mindfully, our minds 
are free from greed, selfishness, hatred, and delusion.

Our goal in meditation has five elements to it: Purification of mind, 
overcoming sorrow and lamentation, overcoming pain and grief, treading 
the right path leading to attainment of self peace, and attaining 
happiness by following that path.

Once you sit to meditate, do not change the position again until the 
end of the time you determined at the beginning.

If you have never meditated before, sit motionlessly for not longer 
than twenty minutes.

Our mind is analogous to a cup of muddy water. The longer you keep a 
cup of muddy water still, the more mud settles down and the water will 
be seen clearly. Similarly, if you keep quiet without moving yous 
body, focusing your entire undivided attention on the subject of your 
meditation, your mind settles down and begins to experience the bliss 
of meditation.

The mind can never be focused without a mental oblect. Therefore we 
must give our mind an object that is readily available every present 
moment. One such object is our breath. Our mind finds it very easy to 
focus itself on the breath, for it is more conspicuous and constant 
than any other object.

When starting to meditate focus your attention exclusively on your 
breath and ignore any thought, memory, sound, smell, taste, etc., 

When starting to meditate focus your attention on feeling your breath 
as it flows through your body. As you continue inhaling and exhaling 
your breath becomes long and your body and mind become relatively 
calm. Subsequetly your breath becomes subtle and you can notice the 
calm and peaceful state of your body.

When you can not concentrate and the mind wonders away, counting might 
help. The purpose of counting is simple, to focus the mind on the 
breath. Once your mind is focused on the breath, give up counting. 
This is a device for gaining concentration. There are numerour ways of 
counting. Any counting should be done mentally. Do not make any sound 
when you count.

To concentrate before meditation, focus your mind like a carpenter: 
A carpenter draws a straight line on a board that he wants to cut. 
Then he cuts the board with his hahdsaw along the straight line he drew. 
He does not look at the teeth of his saw as they move in and out of the 
board. Rather he focuses his entire attention on the line he drew so he 
can cut the board straight. Similarly  keep your mind straight on the 
point where you feel the breath at the rims of your nostrils.

To concentrate before meditation, make your mind like a gate-keeper: A 
gate keeper does not take into account any detail of the people 
entering a house. All he does is notice people entering the house and 
leaving the house through the gate. Similarly, when you concentrate 
you should not take into account any detail of your past experiences. 
Simply notice the feeling of your inhaling and exhaling breath as it 
goes in and out at the rims of your nostrils.

When you concentrate prior to meditation, your mind and body become so 
light that you may feel as if you are floating in the air or on water. 
You may even feel that your body is springing up into the sky. When 
the grossness of your in-and-out breathing has ceased, subtle 
in-and-out breathing arises. This very subtle breath is your mind's 
object of focus. This is a sign of concentration. 

The unity of the mind with the present moment is called momentary 
concentration. Once you gain this degree of concentration, you can use 
it for focusing your attention on anything you experience - the rising 
and falling of your abdomen, the rising and falling of the chest area, 
the rising and falling of any feeling, or the rising and falling of your 
breath your thoughts and so on.

To make any progress in insight meditation you need momentary 
concentration. As your concentration develops don't try to create any 
feeling that is not naturally present in any part of your body. 
Instead, notice whatever feeling arises in the body. When thoughts arise 
notice them too. But don't argue, judge or dwell on anything, just 
observe.

To concentrate before meditation: (1) Sit comfortably. (2) Breath 
deeply a few times (inhale, hold and exhale). (3) Breath normally 
using your lower abdomen. (4) Focus on the sound the air makes as it 
goes in and out of your nose. (5) Focus on the breathing feeling only. 
(6) Slow down the pace of your breath, make it more and more subtle. 
(7) Continue breathing until your breathing becomes unnoticeable, you 
feel relaxed, peaceful and your mind is completely empty of thoughts, 
completely at rest. You have achieved momentary concentration.

To practice meditation use your momentary concentration to explore 
the present moment: (1) Explore your current feelings anywhere in your 
body (e.g. pain, discomfort, pleasure ...etc). (2) Welcome any thoughts 
that come forth and let them in one by one. Simply observe them, 
explore them deeply altogether with the feelings they generate and let 
them come one and go freely. (3) After your mindful exploration, you 
can slowly come back to your breath and repeat the 
concentration and meditation process naturally. 

Meditation does not mean sitting in the lotus position. It is a mental 
skill. It can be practiced anywhere you wish. But a good posture will 
help you learn this skill, and speed your progress and development. 

Deep concentration has the effect of slowing down the thought process 
and speeding up the awareness viewing it. The result is the enhanced 
ability to examing the thought process. Concentration is our 
microscope for viewing subtle internal states.

Meditation tames the mind.

The tamed beast who emerges from mindfulness meditation is a 
well-trained, concentrated mind that can then be used for the 
exceedingly tough job of piercing the layers of illusion that obscure 
reality.

Meditation is a process of retraining the mind. The state you are 
aiming for is one in which you are totally aware of everything that is 
happening in your own perceptual state, exactly the way it happens, 
exactly when it is happening; total, unbroken awareness in present 
time. This is an incredibly high goal, and not to be reached all at 
once. It takes practice, so be patient and start small.

Give yourself time to incorporate the meditation practice into your 
life, and let your practice grow gradually and gently.

Discipline is a difficult word for most of us. It conjures up images of 
somebody standing over you with a stcik, telling you that you're wrong. 
But self-discipline is different. It's the skill of seeing through the 
hollow shouting of your own impulses and piercing their secret. They 
have no power over you.

It's all a show, a deception. Yor urges scream and bluster at you; 
they cajole; they coax; they threaten; but they carry no stick at all. 
You give in to them out of habit. You give in because you never really 
bother to look beyond the threat. It is all empty back there. 

Look within and watch the stuff coming up - restlessness, anxiety, 
impatience, pain - just watch it come and don't get involved. Much to 
your surprise, it will simply go away. It rises, it passes away. As 
simple as that. There is another word for self-discipline. It is 
patience.

There is another word for self-discipline. It is patience.

The main trick in dealing with obstables in meditation is to adopt the 
right attitude. Difficulties are an integral part of your practice. 
They aren't something to be avoided; they are to be used. They provide 
invaluable opportunitties for learning.

The reason we are all stuck in life's mud is that we ceaselessly run 
from our problems and after our desires. Meditation provides us with a 
laboratory situation in which we can examine this syndrome and devise 
strategies for dealing with it. The various snags and hassles that 
arise during meditation are grist for the mill. They are the material 
with which we work.

There is no pleasure without some degree of pain. There is no pain 
without some amount of pleasure. Life is composed of joys and 
miseries. They go hand in hand. Meditation is no exception. You will 
experience good and bad times, ecstasies and fear.

Your ability to cope with trouble depends upon your attitude. If you 
can learn to regard these hassles as opportunitties, as chances to 
develop your practice, you'll make progress. 

Your ability to deal with some issue that arises in meditation will 
carry over into the rest of your life and allow you to smooth out big 
issues that really bother you.

It is essential to learn to confront the less pleasant aspects of 
existence. Our job as meditators is to learn to be parient with 
ourselves, to see ourselvesin an unbiased way, complete with all our 
sorrows and inadequacies. We have to learn to be kind to ourselves. In 
the long run, avoiding unpleasantness is a very unkind thing to do to 
yourself. Paradoxically, kindness entails confronting unpleasantness 
when it arises.

Buddhism advises you not to implant feelings that you don't really 
have or avoid feelings that you do have. If you are miserable you are 
miserable; that is the reality, that is what is happening, so confront 
that. Look it square in the eye without flinching. When you are having 
a bad time, examine that experience, observe it mindfully, study the 
phenomenon and learn its mechanics. The way out of a trap is to study 
the trap itself, learn how it is built. You do this by taking the thing 
apart piece by piece. The trap can't trap you if it has been taken to 
pieces. The result is freedom.

The way out of a trap is to study the trap itself, learn how it is 
built. You do this by taking the thing apart piece by piece. The trap 
can't trap you if it has been taken to pieces. The result is freedom.

Pain exists in the universe; some measure of it is unavoidable. 
Learning to deal with it is not pessimism, but a very pragmatic form 
of optimism.
