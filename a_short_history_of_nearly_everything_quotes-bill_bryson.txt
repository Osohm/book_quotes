If this book has a lesson, it is that we are awfully lucky to be here - every 
living thing. To attain any kind of life at all in this universe appears 
to be quite an achievement. As humans we are doubly lucky. We enjoy not only 
the privilege of existence, but also the ability to appreciate it and make 
it better.
