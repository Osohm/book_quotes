I learned that when it comes to protecting investors, no political party 
has an edge over the conscience of an honest public servant.

From my twelve years as chairman of the American Stock Exchange, I 
knew that investors were almost totally in the dark about how the 
stock markets worked. Collusive practices among the Nasdaq dealers 
were costing investors billions of dollars a year.

The farmer in Des Moines, the teacher in Coral Gables, and the truck 
driver in Syracuse all have a common interest in full disclosure, 
reliable numbers, clearly written documents, and a vigilant regulatory 
system. But no regulator can provide total protection against fraud. 
No law has been devised to anticipate the deceptions and distortions 
that are inevitable in markets fueled by hype and hope. America's 
markets operate by a set of rules that are half written and half 
custom. That makes the individual's responsibility to discern hidden 
motivations and conflicts o interest as important as any law or 
regulation.
